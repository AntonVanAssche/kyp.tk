                        Know Your Parries, was created with the goal of helping
                        fencers improve their technique through practicing their
                        <a

                            >parries</a
                        >. As a fencer myself, I noticed that various fencers
                        around my age, struggle with executing and even properly
                        identifying various parries. This is why I decided to
                        create this website, to help fencers
                        <strong>improve</strong> their
                        <strong>techniques</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This website offers a
                        <strong>3-minute practice session</strong> that
                        simulates a typical fencing bout. During the session,
                        you will be shown an image, the name, and the
                        corresponding number (1-9) of a randomly selected parry.
                        Your task is to execute each parry with proper
                        technique,
                        <strong>focusing on technique over speed</strong>. Keep
                        in mind that speed will come with time and practice. To
                        get the best results, I personally recommend using your
                        fencing weapon (Ã©pÃ©e, foil, or sabre) while practicing
                        your parries. This allows you to get a feel for the
                        weight and balance of your weapon, which will help you
                        to execute your parries more accurately. When using your
                        weapon, make sure you have enough space to perform all
                        parrries, meaning the highline and lowline parries.

                        Keep in mind that the images primarily focus on Ã©pÃ©e and
                        foil, as these are the weapons I'm most familiar with.
                        From my understanding, some parries in sabre are
                        performed differently, but I'm not an expert in sabre,
                        so I can't really say for sure. If you're a sabre
                        fencer,
