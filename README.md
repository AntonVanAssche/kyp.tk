## Description

KYP is a web-based application designed for fencers who want to practice and improve their parry techniques.
The application provides users with a set of randomly generated parries and accompanying audio to help guide them through their practice sessions.

## Features

-   Randomly generated parries
-   Audio guidance for each parry
-   A timer to keep track of the practice session
-   Option to start and stop the practice session
-   A visual representation of each parry

## Getting Started

To get started with KYP, simply visit the website and click the "Start Practice" button.
The application will randomly generate a parry, play an audio file to guide you through the movement, and display a visual representation of the parry on the screen.
The timer will start counting down from 3 minutes, giving you enough time to practice each parry before moving on to the next.
You can stop the practice session at any time by clicking the "Stop Practice" button.
